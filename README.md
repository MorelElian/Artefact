## Summary of the case study, Artefact
I have separated my job in 4 parts : EDA, modeling, results interpretation, further improvements.
# Librairies used
I have mainly used the common librairies for Data Analysis : pandas, matplotlib, numpy and seaborn.
# EDA
In the first part, i try to discover the data and learn more about the given subject. Analysing each csv files independently has allowed me to better understand the situation. However, when i merged the information coming from the 3 files I have discovered several links that i didn't see before. 
Several graphics are present in the notebook to represent those data.
# Modeling
I have chosen to use the K-mean algorithm, which slice the data in K groups, trying to minimize the Pythagorean distance between points. 
I have paid attention to the preprocessing of data, dropping rows with missing values. 
# Result interpretation
I have used pairplots provided by seaborn in the purpose of illustratinf the groups made by the algorithm.
